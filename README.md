</p>

A new feature introduced in the AVRÂ® DB MCU is the Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP) peripheral. In this example, the OPAMP is used as a constant-current driver using a single external resistor. It can be used to drive a load such as LEDs, with constant current and not constant voltage. The OPAMP peripheral also provides the ability to adjust the current setting under firmware control. The configuration for this example can be seen in the figure above. For more information about setup and code, see the [application note](https://microchip.com/DS00003632).

* One resistor (value dependent on desired current)
* Load (LED, etc)

## Setup

* Connect the hardware together as seen in the schematic of the application note

## Operation
* Connect the AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano to a computer using a USB cable
* Download the zip file or clone the example to get the source code
